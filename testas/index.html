    <h2>Produced from April 1994 to 2001, the BMW E38 was the third generation of the BMW 7 Series. The flagship represented an attractive evolution in design language of the prior E32 generation. The new 7 was available with straight-six, V8 and V12 petrol and straight-six and V8 diesel engines. In 2001, the E38 was replaced by the E65 7 Series.</h2>
    <h3>The E38 was the first car available with curtain airbags. It was also the first European car to offer satellite navigation[4] and the first BMW to offer an in-built television. The E38 was the first 7 Series to be available with a diesel engine.</h3>
    <h4>Production started on July 23, 1993 on pilot production models and US specification variants on January 13, 1994, with series production commencing in April 1994 for June 1994 domestic German launch with the 730i and 740i.[1] US-specification cars entered production in September 1994, for November 1994 launch. On February 18, 1994, the E38 BMW 7 Series was unveiled for the 1995 model year via a BMW press release. The 750i production began in November 1994, in advance of its January 1995 launch.[10][11] The last E38 (a silver 740i with a black leather interior) rolled off BMW's assembly line on July 27, 2001[12] to make way for the replacement E65 7 Series.</h4>
    <h1 id=promo>Safety features include ASC+T traction control, headlight washers and auto-leveling low beam xenon HID headlamps. Side tubular airbags (called "Head Protection System") were fitted as standard equipment.[13][14] "Active Comfort Seats" were introduced in 1998, to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger.[15] This system uses two fluid-filled bladders which alternate in height.[16]
        Other equipment includes Electronic Damper Control (called EDC III), power moonroof, rain-sensing wipers, dual zone climate control, electric drivers seat adjustment and electric steering wheel adjustment.
        Double glazed windows were available (called "dual pane glass").[17] Break resistant laminated "security glass" was also available, which is known to delaminate. The delamination occurred with the Protection S357A option only, not with normal S352A dual pane windows.[17][18][19] Bullet-resistant glass was used for the Protection model, with even thicker glass used for the Security model.[17]
        The Sport Package included a sport steering wheel, sports seats, sports suspension, "shadowline" exterior trim and unique wood trim for the interior.[20] Some sports models also included a shorter differential ratio and higher stall speed for the torque converter.[21] This allowed for a 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 5.9 seconds.</h1>
